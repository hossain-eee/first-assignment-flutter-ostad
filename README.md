# Requirement by Ostad
●     Create a Flutter project on Task Management.


●     Implement a main screen that displays a list of tasks.


●     Add a floating action button (FAB) that opens a dialog to add a new task.


●     When the user clicks the FAB, display a dialog with text fields to input task details such as title, description, and deadline.


●     Implement a "Save" button in the dialog to add the new task to the task list.


●     Display the added tasks in the main screen's list.


●     Implement a long press gesture on each task item in the list to open a bottom sheet.


●     The bottom sheet should show the task details along with an option to  delete the task.


●     The bottom sheet will always be closed when delete is pressed.


●     Ensure that the parent screen updates automatically with the modified task details.
