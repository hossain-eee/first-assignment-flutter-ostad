# assignment_module_6

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started
We are creating an app which has a title and search field and 6 images which are actually buttons because these images are child of OutlinedButton. And below the image 3 list which contains image, title and subtitle and at last an icon button to upload image . Images and IconButton show snackbar messages when clicked.  We do all of these by 

Grid image by Wrap() Widget
Most Challenging caption of image is build by Stack(), Position() and FractionalSizedBox()
list of title and subtitle is build by ListView() and ListTile()
And at last add a icon button to upload
